* I started serious speedcubing in high-school and competed in a variety of 
local/national competitions 
* Developed a variety of my own unique algorithms for to ease memorization and speedsolving.
Solved 3x3 (blind/OH), 4x4, 5x5, megaminx... 

Here is my [**official profile**](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014RAME04)

My notable *unofficial* records are **10.2 sec** (3x3), **19.5 sec** (3x3 OH), 
**1:58 min** (3x3 blind). 


***Fun Fact***: I watched my friend, *Angelo Zhang*, from our Cubing Club at UT Austin set the 
then world record for 3x3 Blind with a 22.36s average! I also judged a competitor who 
solved 19 cubes (in one go) blindfolded at Indian Nationals!

## Music

I listen to music for hours on end. A lot of jazz, classic and progressive rock 
(no, I am not 65 years old). 

There's too much incredible music to list, but here are some of noteworthy artists/albums:
