## Biography
![title](assets/home/Headshot_Portrait.jpg){ align=left width=30% style=margin:1em;margin-left:0;margin-top:0.3em;margin-bottom:0.3em }

I am a PhD student at *Carnegie Mellon University* advised by Prof. [Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/) and Prof. [Ben Titzer](https://s3d.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/titzer-ben.html).
My research interests currently span software virtualization and debugging for edge systems, with auxillary interests in compilers and operating systems.
I am particularly excited by *WebAssembly* as a tool for low-level virtualization for edge cyber-physical systems.

I completed my B.S in ECE at *UT Austin*, with a focus in computer architeture and embedded systems. 

I often engross myself in personal projects, hackathons, and engineering endaevors. 
A notably exciting one was a fully-functional in-house out-of-order RISC-V core with custom perfomance-enhancing extensions to 
the ISA. A more detailed list of my personal projects can be found [here](projects.md)

Career goals aside, I am an outdoorsy person with an interest in sports like surfing, trekking, and climbing. 
Music is a fairly great escape into my artistic side. 
Culturally, as an Indian-American with a mixed bag of cultural exposure, I hope to absorb and embrace the best 
parts of both.
