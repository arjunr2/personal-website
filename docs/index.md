## Biography
![title](assets/home/Headshot_Portrait.jpg){ align=left width=30% style=margin:1em;margin-left:0;margin-top:0.3em;margin-bottom:0.3em }

I am a PhD student at *Carnegie Mellon University* under Prof. [Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/).
My research interests currently span edge systems, compilers, 
and operating systems. In particular, I am focused on pushing the system's infrastructure of 
emerging low-level virtualization solutions (*WebAssembly*) into edge cyber-physical systems.
I completed my B.S in ECE at *UT Austin*, with a focus in computer architeture and embedded systems. 

I often engross myself in personal projects, hackathons, and engineering endaevors. 
A notable mention is a fully-functional in-house out-of-order RISC-V core I designed with custom perfomance-enhancing extensions to 
the ISA. A more detailed list of my personal projects can be found [here](projects)

Career goals aside, I am an outdoorsy person with an interest in sports like surfing, trekking, and climbing. 
Music is a fairly great escape into my artistic side. 
Culturally, as an Indian-American with a mixed bag of cultural exposure, I hope to absorb and embrace the best 
parts of both.
