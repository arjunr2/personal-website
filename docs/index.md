## Biography
![title](assets/home/Headshot_Portrait.jpg){ align=left width=30% style=margin:1em;margin-left:0;margin-top:0.3em;margin-bottom:0.3em }

I am a PhD student at *Carnegie Mellon University* advised by Prof. [Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/) and Prof. [Ben Titzer](https://s3d.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/titzer-ben.html).
I am interested in cross-cutting computer systems research, spanning areas of virtualization, operating systems, compilers, and software debugging.
My current research direction encompasses harnessing bytecode virtualization, particularly *WebAssembly*, to develop robust software deployment and debugging infrastructure for cyber-physical edge systems.

I enjoy low-level systems design, and have built  [custom out-of-order RISC-V CPU](projects.md/#extending-the-risc-v-isa), 
an [FPGA](projects.md/#xc2064-fpga-design), and participated in numerous hackathons.
Career goals aside, I am an avid rock climber, biker, surfer, and hiker. 
Playing the guitar and piano is a fairly great escape from the day to day.
With a passion for travelling, I live spontaneously and enjoy embracing elements from many cultures, including my Indian and American roots.

<!---
A notably exciting one was a fully-functional in-house out-of-order RISC-V core with custom perfomance-enhancing extensions to 
the ISA. A more detailed list of my personal projects can be found [here](projects.md)
