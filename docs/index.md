**Howdy! Arjun Ramesh here :wave:**

I am a PhD student at *Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)* under Prof. [Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/).
My research interests include distributed embedded systems, computer architecture, 
and operating systems. In particular, I am focused on expanding emerging low-level virtualization solutions,
like WebAssembly into distributed, cyber-physical systems.
I completed my B.S in ECE at *UT Austin*, with a focus in Computer Architeture and Embedded Systems. 

I often engross myself in personal projects, hackathons, and
product development. A notable mention is my senior capstone research project at UT, where we
designed an in-house out-of-order RISC-V core with custom perfomance
enhancing extensions to system. A more detailed list of my personal projects can be found [here](projects)

Career goals aside, I enjoy playing sports including surfing, badminton, and trekking. Listening
to and playing music is a great way for me to escape the stress of work and express my artistic
side. You can learn more about my hobbies [here](hobbies)

Culturally, I am an Indian-American who has had nearly equal exposure to both cultures. I cannot
begin to choose between which one I value more, so I hope to absorb and embrace the best 
parts of both.
