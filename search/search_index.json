I am interested in cross-cutting computer systems research, spanning areas of virtualization, operating systems, compilers, and software debugging. My current research direction encompasses harnessing bytecode virtualization, particularly WebAssembly, to develop robust software deployment and debugging infrastructure for cyber-physical edge systems.</p> <p>I enjoy low-level systems design, and have built  custom out-of-order RISC-V CPU,  an FPGA, and participated in numerous hackathons. Career goals aside, I am an avid rock climber, biker, surfer, and hiker.  Playing the guitar and piano is a fairly great escape from the day to day. With a passion for travelling, I live spontaneously and enjoy embracing elements from many cultures, including my Indian and American roots.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#news","title":"News","text":"<ul> <li>Sep 2025:  Completed my Thesis Prospectus and am on the lookout for full-time positions</li> <li>Aug 2025:  Tune in to this WebAssembly Unleashed episode where I discuss excitement around debugging with Wasm.</li> <li>Mar 2025:  Starting an internship at F5 Networks Inc. for the Summer '25.</li> <li>Feb 2025:  Paper Accepted -- Interference-Aware Edge Runtime Prediction with Conformal Matrix Completion at MLSys '25! </li> <li>Feb 2025:  Paper Accepted -- Unveiling Heisenbugs with Diversified Execution at OOPSLA '25! </li> <li>Feb 2025:  Invited talk -- Towards Holistic Observability of Edge CPS at Wasm Research Day</li> <li>Jan 2025:  Paper Accepted -- Empowering WebAssembly with Thin-Kernel Interfaces at EuroSys '25!  </li> <li>Jan 2025:  Paper Accepted -- Silverline (collaboration with Bosch Research) at RTAS '25! </li> <li>Oct 2024:  Invited talk -- Unveiling CPS Heisenbugs at Scale at Bosch RDS Tech Colloquium</li> <li>Jun 2024:  Invited talk -- Leveraging Wasm as a Debugging Target at Wasm Research Day</li> <li>Oct 2023:  Invited talk -- Leveraging Wasm Instrumentation at Wasm Research Day (with Tianshu Huang)</li> <li>Apr 2023:  Officially a PhD Candidate after passing my qualifiers</li> <li>Oct 2022:  Invited talk -- Giving the Cloud an Edge with WebAssembly at Wasm Research Day (with Tianshu Huang)</li> <li>Jun 2022:  Edge IoT Internship at Bosch Research begins for the Summer of '22!</li> <li>Aug 2021:  Started my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University!</li> <li>May 2021:  Graduated with a Bachelors degree from UT Austin  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p> Work Address </p> <p>CIC 2313E (2nd floor)  4720 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213</p> <p> arjunr2@andrew.cmu.edu</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"experience/","title":"Professional Experience","text":""},{"location":"experience/#industry","title":"Industry","text":""},{"location":"experience/#bosch-research","title":"Bosch Research","text":"<p> IoT Edge Integration Intern \u2003|\u2003  Pittsburgh, PA</p> <ul> <li>Development towards Silverline, a framework for management and orchestration of real-time distributed workloads</li> <li>Deployed a WebAssembly-virtualized cloud-edge distributed inverted pendulum application with 2ms control-loop on CtrlX</li> </ul> <p> C/C++, \u00a0Python Linux, Virtualization, Embedded Systems </p>"},{"location":"experience/#apple-inc","title":"Apple Inc.","text":"<p> GPU Design Verification Intern \u2003|\u2003  Austin, TX</p> <ul> <li>Improved speed and coverage of address generation test set for GPU memory hierarchy</li> <li>Developed a library to allow reproducability of tests for targeted constraint testing</li> <li>Bringup of UVM testbenches for memory hierarchy</li> </ul> <p> SystemVerilog, \u00a0Python UVM</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"experience/#centaur-technology-inc","title":"Centaur Technology Inc.","text":"<p> CPU Design Verification Intern \u2003|\u2003  Austin, TX</p> <ul> <li>Created a real-time debugging tool to monitor chip performance using ELK stack</li> <li>Tested and debugged AVX-512 instructions</li> <li>Improved pre-silicon test tools for register file verification</li> <li>DevOps work: CI/CD, bugreport database management and front-end scripting</li> </ul> <p> Python, \u00a0Ruby, \u00a0SystemVerilog ELK, \u00a0Jenkins, \u00a0Docker, \u00a0Traefik</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"experience/#qube-cinema-inc","title":"Qube Cinema Inc.","text":"<p> Software Engineering Intern \u2003|\u2003  Chennai, India</p> <ul> <li>Worked on iCount - a commercial product to count seat occupancy in theaters<ul> <li>Reworked the CNN in Keras using transfer learning on ResNet50 model</li> <li>Added augmentation to account for poorly lit environmental conditions</li> <li>Accuracy of 92% on uncorrelated test set</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> Tensorflow, \u00a0Python Keras</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"experience/#lucid-imaging-pvt-ltd","title":"Lucid Imaging Pvt.
