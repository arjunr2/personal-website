I am interested in cross-cutting computer systems research, spanning areas of virtualization, operating systems, and compilers with an embedded systems flavor. My current research direction investigates harnessing bytecode virtualization, particularly WebAssembly, to unlock safe deployment and debuggability in resource-constrained cyber-physical edge systems.</p> <p>I enjoy low-level systems design, and have built  custom out-of-order RISC-V CPU,  an FPGA, and participated in numerous hackathons-style events. Career goals aside, I am an avid rock climber, biker, surfer, and hiker.  Playing the guitar and piano is a fairly great escape from the day to day. With a passion for travelling, I live spontaneously and enjoy embracing elements from many cultures, including my Indian and American roots.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#news","title":"News","text":"<ul> <li>Feb 2025:  LLVM-22 release introduces a target for WALI!
